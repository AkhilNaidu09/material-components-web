Shapes direct attention, identify components, communicate state, and express brand.

> Currently shape system for web only supports rounded corners.

## Installation

```
npm install @material/shape
```

## Basic Usage

### Styles

```scss
@import "@material/shape/mixins";
@import "@material/shape/functions";
```

## Style Customization

### Sass Variables

Components are categorized as small, medium and large in shape system. Overriding below sass variables applies shape (rounded) to respective categories. For example, overriding `$mdc-shape-medium-radius` variable would apply shape to all components that belong to medium category.

Variable | Description
--- | ---
`$mdc-shape-small-surface-radius` | Rounded shape radius size for small surface components. Default value `4px`.
`$mdc-shape-medium-surface-radius` | Rounded shape radius size for medium surface components. Default value `8px`.
`$mdc-shape-large-surface-radius` | Rounded shape radius size for large surface components. Default value `0`.

Please refer [Material Design guidelines: Shape](https://material.io/go/design-shape) to learn about how components are categories.

### Sass Mixins

Mixin | Description
--- | ---
`mdc-shape-radius($radius, $rtl-reflexive)` | Shape API used by all other components to apply radius to appropriate corners. `$radius` can be single value or list of 4 radius corner values. Set `$rtl-reflexive` to true to flip the radius in RTL case, `false` by default.

> Use `mdc-shape-resolve-percentage-radius` sass function to resolve percentage unit value to absolute radius value.

### Sass Functions

Function | Description
--- | ---
`mdc-shape-flip-radius($radius)` | Function that flips the radius in RTL context. $radius is list of corner values it can be length of 4, 3 or 2.
`mdc-shape-resolve-percentage-radius($component-height, $radius)` | Function that calculates the absolute radius value based on its component height. Use this for fixed height components only.
`mdc-shape-prop-value($radius)` | Returns radius value of shape category - `large`, `medium` or `small`. Otherwise, it returns the `$radius` itself if valid. `$radius` can be a single value or list of 4.
`mdc-shape-mask-top-radius($radius)` | Accepts radius number or list of 2 radius values and returns 4 value list with top-left value, top-right value, bottom-right 0, bottom-left 0. Throws error when length of radius is more than 2.

### Additional Information

#### Shapes for fixed height components

Styles for applying shape to button component looks like this.

```scss
@include mdc-shape-radius(mdc-shape-resolve-percentage-radius($mdc-button-height, $radius));
```

Where, `$mdc-button-height` is the height of standard button and `$radius` is the size of shape. `mdc-shape-resolve-percentage-radius` function is used to resolve percentage unit value to absolute `$radius` value based on component height.

#### Shapes for dynamic height components

Styles for applying shapes to dynamic height component like card looks like this:

```scss
@include mdc-shape-radius($radius);
```

Where, `$radius` is absolute value only.

#### Shapes for components on specific corners

Styles for applying shapes for specific corners such as drawer looks like this:

```scss
@include mdc-shape-radius((0, $radius, $radius, 0), $rtl-reflexive: true);
```

Where, only top-right & bottom-right corners are customizable and it automatically flips radius values based on RTL context when `$rtl-reflexive` is set to true.

#### Component theming

The styles for applying custom shape to button component instance looks like this:

```scss
@import "@material/button/mixins";

.my-custom-button {
  @include mdc-button-shape-radius(50%);
}
```

In this example, the above styles applies 50% (pill) shape to button. It can also be absolute value (e.g., `8px`);

> You would indirectly use the Shape API through respective component's mixin which takes care of applying radius to applicable corners for all its variants.
